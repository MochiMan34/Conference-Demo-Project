# Conference-Demo-Project

Another coding project for school. 

Coding Problem: I had to code a program named "ConferencesDemo" For a hotel that hosts business conferences. Users should be allowed to enter data 
about 5 conference objects and displays them in order of attendance from smallest to largest. An Icomparable.CompareTo() interface had to be used 
to sort the conference objects regarding the number of attendees.
